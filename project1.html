<h1> Wireless Hacking - Evil Twin Attack </h1>
<br> <h2> Oct 2019 - Dec 2019 </h2>

<body>
Project description: Utilized Kali Linux terminal and the Aircrack-ng suite along with an Alfa wireless adapter to implement an evil twin attack in a controlled environment. This involved spoofing a legitimate AP and sending deauthentication packets in order to get clients to reconnect to our wireless network, at which point they would become a lot more vulnerable, as their traffic could be potentially monitored or redirected by us.
